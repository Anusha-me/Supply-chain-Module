This project consists of two key functional modules:

1. Forecasting Module:
   - Uses Exponential Smoothing to generate demand forecasts
   - Inputs: Time-series data (e.g., monthly sales)
   - Outputs: Forecasted demand values

2. Optimization Module:
   - Solves the Transportation Problem using Linear Programming (PuLP)
   - Inputs: Supply, Demand, Cost Matrix
   - Outputs: Optimal shipping routes and total minimized cost
